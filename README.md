INTRODUCTION
------------
Drupal was selected as the basis for this as it came with many critical features
already supported: User accounts, login, MySQL database storage, file handling,
display configuration and access control, and ability to be modified.

OLD CODE
--------
There is a folder in this repo under the name "depr_code". This is code that
predates the move to Drupal as our codebase. It mostly supported the planewalker
database systems for search: God's List etc. That code has now been moved to the
Drupal 6 module "planewalker_custom".
